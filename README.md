**Stopwatch**
 - It is specialized in measuring elapsed time when you check how long it takes to solve problems. This is between project and hobby, not homework.

**Purpose**
 - There are many tests and problems with math, science, license test etc. If there will be limited testing time, you must distributed 
   the time well to solve all problems. You have to learn and pratice to solve problems within testing time. 
 - Therefore, I want to make stopwatch measuring time and to see how it is going.
 
**My pleasure**
 - If someone want to help me a little or little, that's my pleasure regardless of how much you can help. I willing to share my project
   while inviting [invision for myproject](https://invis.io/DPGNB45J8HV), 'Collaborative UI design site'.
